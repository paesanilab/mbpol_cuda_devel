## This file lists the sequence of atom relationship saved in G_function matrix
## Each line represents a relationship between the first atom and the rest atoms
## The G_function matrix will be constructed according to the line order of this file.
##
## E.g. in this file:
##   (1st line) H H
##   (2nd line) H O O
##   (3rd line) H O 
## Then the G_function matrix will be constructed in [HH - HOO - HO] sequence. 
##

H H
#H O
#H O O
H H O
#H H H
#O H
#O O
#O H O
